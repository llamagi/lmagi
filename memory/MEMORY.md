memory.py

The memory.py module is designed for the easyAGI platform to manage the local file system folder structure and memory storage. It handles the creation and management of short-term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM), and episodic memory, and stores truths based on Socratic reasoning and logic. The module ensures that different types of memory are appropriately stored, retrieved, and managed. Folder Structure

STM (Short Term Memory): Stores recent conversation inputs and responses.
LTM (Long Term Memory): Stores long-term memory entries.
Episodic Memory: Stores multi-modal input response memory.
Truth: Stores beliefs, truths, and facts, distinguishing facts from tautologies using Socratic reasoning.
Agency: Contains executable files controlled by the mastermind component.
Logs: Stores log files for debugging and tracking purposes.
MINDX: Contains internal reasoning and no-premise logs.

Constants

The following constants define the folder structure for the memory system:

MEMORY_FOLDER = "./memory/"
STM_FOLDER = MEMORY_FOLDER + "stm/"
LTM_FOLDER = MEMORY_FOLDER + "ltm/"
EPISODIC_FOLDER = MEMORY_FOLDER + "episodic/"
TRUTH_FOLDER = MEMORY_FOLDER + "truth/"
LOGS_FOLDER = MEMORY_FOLDER + "logs/"
MINDX_FOLDER = "./mindx/"
AGENCY_FOLDER = MINDX_FOLDER + "agency/"

Classes
DialogEntry

class DialogEntry:
    def __init__(self, instruction, response):
        self.instruction = instruction
        self.response = response

A simple class to encapsulate an instruction-response pair.
Functions
create_memory_folders

def create_memory_folders():
    ...

Creates the necessary folder structure for the memory system if it doesn't already exist
store_in_stm

def store_in_ltm(dialog_entry):
    ...

Stores a DialogEntry object in the short-term memory (STM) folder.
store_in_ltm

def store_in_ltm(dialog_entry):
    ...

Stores a DialogEntry object in the long-term memory (LTM) folder
store_episodic_memory

def store_episodic_memory(episode):
    ...

Stores an episodic memory entry
save_valid_truth

def save_valid_truth(valid_truth):
    ...

Saves a valid truth entry in the truth folder.
save_conversation_memory

def save_conversation_memory(memory):
    ...

Saves conversation input and response to the short-term memory folder
save_internal_reasoning

def save_internal_reasoning(memory):
    ...

Saves internal reasoning, including no-premise entries, to the MINDX folder
load_conversation_memory

def load_conversation_memory():
    ...

Loads all conversation memories from the memory folder
delete_conversation_memory

def delete_conversation_memory():
    ...

def get_latest_memory():

...

def get_latest_memory():
    ...

Usage Examples
Creating Memory Folders

create_memory_folders()

Ensure the folder structure exists before performing any memory operations.
Store dialogue entries in Short-Term Memory

```python
dialog_entry = DialogEntry("Hello, how are you?", "I am good, thank you!")
store_in_stm(dialog_entry)

Store in Long-Term Memory

store_in_ltm(dialog_entry)

Storing Episodic Memory

python
episode = {"event": "User logged in", "timestamp": time.time()}
store_episodic_memory(episode)

Saving Valid Truth

python
valid_truth = {"statement": "The sky is blue", "verified": True}
save_valid_truth(valid_truth)

Saving Conversation Memory

python
conversation_memory = {
    "instruction": "Tell me a joke.",
    "response": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!"
}
save_conversation_memory(conversation_memory)

Saving Internal Reasoning

```python
internal_reasoning = {
    "conclusion": "This is a well-formed logical statement.",
    "premises": ["Premise 1", "Premise 2"]
}
save_internal_reasoning(internal_reasoning)

Loading Conversation Memory

python
all_memory = load_conversation_memory()
print(all_memory)

Deleting Conversation Memory

python
delete_conversation_memory()

Getting the Latest Memory

python
latest_memory = get_latest_memory()
print(latest_memory)

The memory.py module is a crucial component of the easyAGI platform providing a structured approach to managing different types of memory and truths. By creating and maintaining a well-organized file system, memory.py ensures that conversation data, internal reasoning, and truths are stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the module's functionality, helping easyAGI developers understand and utilize memory storage capabilities effectively to enhance LLM
